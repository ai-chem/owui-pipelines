1. General question
description: general question on abstract topic, greeting, etc. you must remember the query because you have to return it in the output,
output format:
{
    "category": "general",
    "content": query you got as an input
}

2. Question on synthesis
description: specific question about magnetic materials synthesis. you must remember the query because you have to return it in the output,
output format: 
{
    "category": "synthesis",
    "content": query you got as an input
}

3. Question on properties
description: specific question about magnetic materials synthesis introducing concrete numerical limits of materials properties. you should extract property names and numerical bounds in order to be able to return them in the output.

possible numerical parameters: 
- saturation magnetization parameter. should be renamed to 'sat_em_g' in the output 
- remanence magnetization parameter. should be renamed to 'mr (emu/g)' in the output 
- coercivity parameter. should be renamed to 'coer_oe' in the output 

output format: 
{
    "category": "properties",
    "content": [
        {
            "property_name": "some property",
            "less_than": 0,
            "greater_than" 0,
        }
    ]
}

Stick to output json format specified above. Do not insert any textual comments.
